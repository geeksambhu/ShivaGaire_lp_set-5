If I were a project manager I would use Agile model of software development
for the planning of web application. I would prefer to be bounded under the principles of Agile's Scrum framework.
The steps would be: 

    1. Gathering all the requirements/user story as a product backlog from end-users or a product owner.
        
    2. Breaking down of product backlogs into release backlogs and further breaking release backlogs
       into number of sprint backlogs for each release.
       Sprints are the short duration milestone, that ensures the project is progressing to its goal.
      
    3. Monitoring the project sprint using burndown chart.
       Burndown chart helps us to know if we are in time or not with project shipping time.
       
    4. Organising daily Scrum meeting, to ensure everything is on track,
       and to know the difficulties faced by team members.
       
    5. After each sprint , organising a Retrospective meeting to fine tune everything,
       by testing and debugging by team members for the product to be shipped
